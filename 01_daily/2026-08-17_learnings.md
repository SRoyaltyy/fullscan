## 3. What we learned (by scope)

Each scope lists recent win and loss hypotheses: the **counterfactual ask**, the **experiment** to run next, and the **policy candidate** (do instead).

### `general` — 8 wins, 4 losses

#### WIN — 2026-08-11
- **When:** [general] Predicted down, market/sector went down (pct=-0.32, score=-2.475, sector=).
- **Ask:** Could magnitude/conviction have been better? Double-count in factors? Missing confirming source?
- **Experiment:** [general] On similar setups, test milder bands when |score|<4; log whether lagging tape factors overrode leading ones.
- **Do instead:** [general] Keep direction; shrink confidence on modest |score| when magnitude historically misses.
- **Wrong if:** [general] Wrong if milder bands hurt direction accuracy over 10 runs.

Full text lives in `02_lessons/active/`. Summaries also feed `mutable_policy.md`.

## 5. How these learnings affect daily workflows

### General market predict (`run_predict` / daily pipeline)
- Loads `mutable_policy.md` + `02_lessons/active/*` via `memory.prediction_context()`.
- Must answer methodology checklist in MEMORY_CONFIRM.
- Ops lessons (missing predict file) change grading, not B0–B7 math.
- Macro / geo / regime lessons change how Channel-2 evidence is weighted in narrative.

### Per-sector predict (`run_sector_predict` / sector daily)
- Loads the **same** `mutable_policy.md` via `sector_memory` (filter lines for this sector + general).
- Sector-specific active lessons (XLB temper, XLK geo, XLE Hormuz, staples/CPI) apply to S0–S4 scoring judgment.
- Weak sectors in accuracy table → extra caution, milder bands, demand confirming tape.

### Sector / general outcome + reflect
- Outcomes grade hits; reflect writes new candidates.
- Next learn_cycle mines those candidates again (promote if complete).

### News parse + news actions
- Hypotheses under scope `news` steer event-family conviction and ticker mapping.
- Prefer 1d close quality over ever-touch MFE when ranking event edges.
- Does not change SCORES format; changes which edges deserve size.

### Label + Weather + Join
- `weather_rules_proposals.json` may suggest threshold nudges (not auto-applied).
- Label membership unchanged; weather stances may tighten if proposals are accepted later.
- Join/match inherits weather; better weather → cleaner favorable/hostile books.

### HIT board / report card
- Still pure arithmetic over scoreboard; learn_cycle does not rewrite history.
- Accuracy-by-topic in this file should match HIT board trends over time.

## 6. Concrete operating rules for tomorrow

1. **General:** Follow active ops + macro lessons; apply open experiments when setup matches.
2. **Weak sectors** (HIT% soft in §2): default to milder magnitude; demand ETF tape confirmation.
3. **Strong general / solid sectors:** Do not loosen risk controls only because recent hits look good.
4. **News:** Prefer event families with clean 1d close evidence; do not size on MFE alone.
5. **Weather/join:** Review `weather_rules_proposals.json` before accepting threshold changes.
6. **All predicts:** Core output blocks stay fixed; only judgment/weights/search emphasis change.
