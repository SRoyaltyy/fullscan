This file is the **human read** of one run. CSV/JSON next to it are the machine files.

## How today's rank is built

Every liquid name ($80M+ mcap, 500k+ ADV) gets six signals, then a mid-cap opportunity add-on:

1. **Join × weather** — do this *kind* of stock (sector, size, trend, leverage, earnings) fit today's tape?
2. **Sector / general predict** — same-day LLM calls only. Missing file = 0, never yesterday's leftover.
3. **News / judge** — headlines plus the news-judge ticker list (AU/ADBE-style).
4. **AB checklist** — structure score + P01–P04 (beats peers? peers up? industry up? sector board up?).
5. **Peer RS** — this week's return vs that name's own correlated basket. Kills XLE clones.
6. **Mid-cap opportunity** — extra points for liquid small/mid ($400M–$20B) that are not jammed at the 52-week high. Micros skipped. Max 4 large/mega.

**All-green BUY.** A name is green when join, AB, and peer are all ≥ +0.05, sector and news are not red, and relvol is not dead (< 0.7). General is a market-wide SPX stamp — a modest red general does not empty the pile. A hard-red general (≤ −0.25) is a veto unless the same-day sector call is green. Event-scanner sector tilt is clipped to ±0.20 so it cannot invert the day's essay. mid_opp is capped at +0.20 and zeroed on hard sector-red names. BUY also drops LAG+peer-losers, printed dead volume, and the lookback marks the sheet already used: 🚨 alarm (purely worse), Cond-red, region-red, and featured fade setups (first_crack / alarm|heat=bad). 🔵 blue gets a small boost. ⚪ white (no red cells) is recorded but not a hard gate — a red general makes it empty. If ≥ 8 liquid green names survive the $400M / 4-per-sector / 3-per-industry / 4 large-mega caps, BUY 15 is filled from that pile by green_rank (no opp). If the pile is thinner (usually AB or peers all zeros), the ranker keeps the weighted walk under the same vetoes. **SELL always ranks on core weights** and never shorts a green name when the pile is used.

**1d** leans on news + AB + peers. **1m** drops news and leans on AB + peers + join.
A sector headline (e.g. ADBE) cannot zero a mid-cap that just beat earnings or is leading its own peers.

## Today's regime

- Weather risk: **off**
- General predict (same-day): -0.47 (present)
- Sector predicts this date: 10/11 (ok)
- News tickers in play: 120
- AB coverage: 2551 names · peer RS: 2400
- Universe after liquidity: 2685
- BUY window: $80M ADV, opportunity $400M–$20B, max 4/sector, 3/industry, 4 large/mega
- News names after digest+judge: 105

## All-green BUY / SELL

- Mode: **green_pile** · SELL **core_weights_ex_green**
- Pile: **93** liquid all-green names (need ≥ 8) of 2685
- Core fired: join=yes, AB=yes, peer=yes
- pile 93 ≥ 8 liquid all-green names — BUY 15 from the pile by green_rank (no opp); SELL is core weights on the non-green remainder
