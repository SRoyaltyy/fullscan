# Improvement tracker — 2026-09-14T17:43:24-04:00

Rolling direction/magnitude hit of the *shipped* prediction vs three naive baselines computed on the same graded runs (always up, always down, same direction as the previous graded session of that topic). `edge` = engine direction hit minus the best baseline over the same window. Sessions are dated by the predicted session; sectors are pooled (11 per day).

## General market (SPX) — 26 graded runs over 26 sessions

**Read:** slipping; not beating best baseline by -20% (last 10 sessions)

Walk-forward replay estimate for v2 on the same history: **71%** direction / 57% magnitude (n=28, `REPLAY_HARNESS.md` 2026-09-12). The live v2 curve above should converge toward this as sessions accumulate; if it sits well below it for 20+ sessions, the anchor inputs or the LLM components changed.
