# Hard-red sit experiment

**A short-only (pre-open): KILL.** **B dip-scoop X=1.0% (intraday): KILL.**

Research only. Live `flatten_robust` buys and Webull `combo_sh_macd_5050_shared` stay on full hard-red sit. This board does not wire either idea. Excel does not own the sit. Deep-corr was not waited on.

## Clock split (Manager lock)

**A short-only** is a **pre-open** policy decision, made before 09:30 when morning S is already ≤−3. The short kid may fire at the official open. Excel may pre-filter short-eligible names via open-knowable CLEAR letters only (`FQ` / `ER` / `EP` stretch = yesterday already ran). Those letters CLEAR as *long avoids* on the Yahoo analog — they are a fade hint here, **not** a short CLEAR. Missing letters pass through. Excel does **not** own the sit.

**B long dip-scoop** is **intraday**, after 09:30. Open is known. The trigger is first touch of open−X% on same-day OHLC (session low = daily first-hit proxy). Close / last / Gap / Finviz Price never trigger. Close only grades after fees.

## Board — what would have happened

KILL A short-only (pre-open): thin n=11 fires (bar ≥30). After-fee win 50.0%. webull n=11 win=50%; flatten n=0 win=—. Do not change live sit on this sample.

KILL B dip-scoop X=1.0% (intraday): 55 fires but after-fee win 49.1% ≤ 55%. webull n=26 win=54%; flatten n=29 win=45%

On **2026-09-14** morning S was **-11.002** (hard-red). Live policy `combo_sh_macd_5050_shared` (#232) and `flatten_robust` sat every new lot.

Webull longs that sat: CMRC (open 3.510, low −1.14% — would scoop at 0.5%, 1.0%, last 3.470 (not 16:00)); GPRO (open 1.370, low −4.38% — would scoop at 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 3.0%, last 1.360 (not 16:00)); VERI (open 1.035, low −5.30% — would scoop at 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 3.0%, last 1.075 (not 16:00)); HUT (open 92.300, low −2.95% — would scoop at 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, last 92.670 (not 16:00)); INDP (open 2.800, low −1.07% — would scoop at 0.5%, 1.0%, last 2.890 (not 16:00)).
Webull shorts that sat (the short kid): BKV (short at open 24.26 → last 24.31; 1-share after-fee -0.56, fee-dominated, not cash-book size, Excel ineligible); AMD (short at open 486.13 → last 491.90; 1-share after-fee -9.78, fee-dominated, not cash-book size, Excel eligible (FQ,EP)).
Flatten/io would-haves that sat: CVE (open 33.640, low −0.51% — would scoop at 0.5%, last 33.875 (not 16:00)); BG (open 123.850, low −0.33% — no X on the grid hit, last 124.930 (not 16:00)); NVT (open 150.000, low −2.80% — would scoop at 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, last 147.600 (not 16:00)); DK (open 77.760, low −3.07% — would scoop at 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 3.0%, last 78.290 (not 16:00)).

Clock split: (A) short-only is a pre-open policy call — shorts fire at the clock-clean 09:30 open if S≤−3. Excel may pre-filter those names via open-knowable letters (FQ/ER/EP stretch); it does not own the sit. Deep-corr was not run. (B) long scoop is *intraday* after 09:30: trigger is first touch of open−X% (session low as the daily proxy). Close / last grades the fire — it does not trigger it. 09-14 Yahoo close is last-so-far, not 16:00. Flatten's live card used last-close for DK; scoop uses the official 09:30 open.

## RESEARCH per sleeve (paper, not a wire)

**2026-09-17** — `1` sit sleeves with looked names / `1` sit sleeves total. Live policy sits. KEEP bar unchanged. Label: **RESEARCH**.

Per-sleeve paper counterfactuals on looked names. Live sit stays default. KEEP bar unchanged. (A) short-only fires the short kid at the 09:30 open. (B) dip-scoop longs wait for open−X% (session low / Elite live). Close does not trigger.

| Sleeve | Side | (A) short-only @ open | (B) dip-scoop X% |
|---|---|---|---|
| `flatten_robust` | long | — | IQV miss; RDNT miss; AVAH miss; BLFS miss; AUPH miss; OVID miss; SANM miss; ORCL miss; NVT miss; COHU miss |

Scoop trigger = official open + session low (Elite live only when the low has not printed). Close / last / Theme Radar never trigger. #236 KILL of global short-only / dip-scoop stands — this table is display/paper only.

Window `2026-08-13 → 2026-09-14` (22 sessions). Hard-red mornings (S≤-3): **10** — `2026-08-18` S=-6.2, `2026-08-19` S=-7.2, `2026-08-24` S=-5.175, `2026-08-31` S=-5.85, `2026-09-01` S=-6.3, `2026-09-02` S=-3.825, `2026-09-08` S=-11.475, `2026-09-09` S=-13.95, `2026-09-10` S=-13.275, `2026-09-14` S=-11.002.

Book% on the continuous $10k combo path is **not** the KEEP bar. Scoop / short-only books look richer because those extra lots stay held into later non-red days. KEEP only grades the hard-red **fires** after Futubull fees. A fat Book% with a coin-flip hard-red win rate is still KILL.

## KEEP bar

Need **≥30 fires** where the tape can print them, **> 55% after Futubull fees**, and **both tapes** (Webull combo + flatten/io) when that tape can actually fire. Walk-forward mines X on hidden windows; a full-sample winner that dies OOS is KILL. Thin n is KILL.

After-fee caveat: every graded fire pays the Futubull US round-trip. Scoop **trigger** is open + session low only (first touch of open−X%). Close is the grade, not the trigger. Daily OHLC cannot prove the print happened after 09:30, so scoop P&L is slightly optimistic. A missing 09:30 open is a skip — never Gap, last, or prior close. 09-14 may lack a 16:00 mark; those rows stay ungraded.

## Webull combo tape

Cash book is the audited `simulate_shared` ledger on `combo_sh_macd_5050_shared` (short news🔴 ∩ MACD-up + hot-4, shared 50/50, $10k, whole shares, sell first). Live sit is the control. (A) is pre-open short-only. (B) is the after-09:30 open−X% scoop (low touches the limit; close grades).

## Flatten / .io tape

Long book only (`flatten_robust` has no short kid). Live sit and (A) short-only print **zero** new lots — same as live. (B) scoops the hard-red would-have .io names after open−X%, 1 share each, exit at the 3d horizon close. Trigger still uses open+low only.

| Variant | Hard-red fires | After-fee win | After-fee $ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| live sit (control) | 0 | — | +0.00 |
| (A) short-only (N/A — flatten has no short kid) | 0 | — | +0.00 |

## Walk-forward (mine X, freeze, score hidden)

4 folds — same cut as `walkforward_factor_mine` (first cutoff 2026-08-20, step 4, forward 4). Each cutoff picks the IS scoop X with the best after-fee hard-red win%, then scores that logic on the hidden window. Short-only has nothing to mine; OOS fires are pooled.

| Cutoff | Hidden | IS best X | IS win | OOS short n/win | OOS 0.5% | OOS 1% | OOS 1.5% | OOS 2% | OOS 3% |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

Pooled OOS short-only: n=7 win=16.7% $=-791.82.

Pooled OOS scoop by X:

## Gate (do not change live)

Hard-red S≤−3 currently blocks **long and short** new lots in:

1. `src/combo_broker.py` `size_combo_tickets` — Webull paper `combo_sh_macd_5050_shared` tickets (`hard_red` → skip every kid).
2. `src/factor_mine_combo.py` `simulate_shared` — the cash book used to grade that combo.
3. `src/factor_mine_book.py` `simulate_book` / `flatten_robust` `hard_red_no_new` — flatten/io sits new buys.

This experiment adds opt-in `hard_red_mode` (`sit` / `short_only` / `dip_scoop` / `short_and_scoop`) with default **sit**. Live callers do not pass a mode.

## KEEP / KILL

**A short-only (pre-open): KILL.** KILL A short-only (pre-open): thin n=11 fires (bar ≥30). After-fee win 50.0%. webull n=11 win=50%; flatten n=0 win=—. Do not change live sit on this sample.

**A · Excel letter pre-filter: KILL.** KILL A short-only · Excel letter pre-filter: thin n=7 fires (bar ≥30). After-fee win 57.1%. webull n=7 win=57%. Do not change live sit on this sample.

**B dip-scoop X=1.0% (intraday): KILL.** KILL B dip-scoop X=1.0% (intraday): 55 fires but after-fee win 49.1% ≤ 55%. webull n=26 win=54%; flatten n=29 win=45%
