# Factor mine action — `flatten_h5_sizeup`

_Book rules: $10k · whole shares · Futubull fees · leftover cash split on new names · sell first · min-hold **5** sessions · fill 09:30 open · hard-red S≤-3 sit · shorts marked as liability (equity ≥ 2× notional). Live `flatten_robust` is not changed._

Buys the flatten **wish-list** even on io/HOLD mornings — live `flatten_robust` would not send 09:30 tickets those days. See `flatten_live_*` for the gated book.

Side **long** · universe `flatten` · top 8 · rank `list` · size `leftover` · sell `list` · S-boost `sizeup` · S≥+5: 1.35× leftover

Cash book **+22.84%** ($12,284) · signal-only (no cash/fees) was +67.92%. Starts YES **16/17**. Fills 75 · skips 194 · realized $+1824.45.

## Why these stocks

Same shape as [FLATTEN_LOOKBACK_ACTION.md](../FLATTEN_LOOKBACK_ACTION.md): the 09:30 packet + leftover cash + lots on hand decide the ticket. Same-day Change% is outcome only.

- **Universe** `flatten` — candidate list at 09:30 (flatten wish-list, union, probable, yday gainer, or OHLC hot).
- **Gate** `none (list as ranked)` · **rank** `list order` · **top_n** 8 (S≥+5 may raise this when S-boost is `sizeup`).
- **Size** `leftover` splits leftover cash among *new* names only. Rank-weight / top-heavy still cannot invent money.
- **Sell** `list` after min-hold **5**. We never sell a ticker we do not hold. Early 🚨 / last-red / news🔴 can still exit inside the floor.
- **Entry:** Buys the flatten **wish-list** even on io/HOLD mornings — live `flatten_robust` would not send 09:30 tickets those days. See `flatten_live_*` for the gated book.

## State audit

**PASS** · 0 violations. Independent replay of fills never sold an unheld lot and never spent past leftover cash. Close cash $66.06.
