## How this sleeve decides (like you are 10)

Imagine a kid with $10,000 at the 09:30 school bell. They look at the mixed morning shopping list (every name that showed up on any 09:30 list that day) and only buy names that pass every must-have on the checklist and skip anything on the must-not list. They take up to 8 names, spend leftover cash on whole shares, and hold at least 1 morning(s). They sell when the name falls off the list (after the timer). They never peek at today's report card (Change%) to pick. This sleeve bets the price will rise.

### What it looks at (inputs)

- Shopping list: the mixed morning shopping list (every name that showed up on any 09:30 list that day).
- Clock: 09:30 ET only. The sleeve never peeks at today's Change%, Gap, RelVol, or the printed book to decide.
- News, if used, is the morning packet box or yesterday's headline — never a later scrape.
- Money: leftover cash from yesterday + the lots we already hold. It can only spend cash it has and only sell shares it holds.
- Fill price: the 09:30 open, whole shares, Futubull fees.
- Morning weather S: if S ≤ −3 the sleeve sits (no new buys).
- Must-have: prior RSI is oversold (≤30) — Finviz prior export, else computed on prior bars.
- Must-have: prior MACD histogram is above zero (momentum still up).
- Must-not: the 🚨 alarm is on (cameras got worse overnight).
- Must-not: the news camera (does the morning packet like the headline?) is red.

### When it buys

- At 09:30, take names on the mixed morning shopping list (every name that showed up on any 09:30 list that day) that pass the must-haves.
- If morning S ≤ −3, buy nobody new (hard-red sit).
- A name is allowed only when every must-have is true.
- A name is thrown out if any must-not is true.
- Keep the first 8 names in list order.
- Split leftover cash equally across *new* names (not ones we already hold).
- Skip a name if the slice cannot buy 1 share after fees.
- This is a LONG sleeve: it buys shares and wants the price to go up.

### When it sells

- Sell first, then buy. Never sell a ticker we do not hold.
- Minimum hold is 1 session(s) — the buy morning counts as 1.
- No extra panic button — only the hold timer and the sell rule below.
- List-drop: after 1 session(s), sell at the 09:30 open if the name is no longer on today's list. If it fell off earlier, we still wait out the minimum hold.
- Fills are at the 09:30 open. Fees come out of cash. Overnight, cash does not change.

## Why these stocks

Same shape as [FLATTEN_LOOKBACK_ACTION.md](../FLATTEN_LOOKBACK_ACTION.md): the 09:30 packet + leftover cash + lots on hand decide the ticket. Same-day Change% is outcome only.

- **Universe** `union` — candidate list at 09:30 (flatten wish-list, union, probable, yday gainer, or OHLC hot).
- **Gate** `rsi_os=True,macd_up=True` · **rank** `list order` · **top_n** 8.
- **Size** `leftover` splits leftover cash among *new* names only. Rank-weight / top-heavy still cannot invent money.
- **Sell** `list` after min-hold **1**. We never sell a ticker we do not hold. Early 🚨 / last-red / news🔴 can still exit inside the floor.
- **Entry:** Research universe (not the live flatten gate). Cash/share/fee rules still apply.

## State audit

**PASS** · 0 violations. Independent replay of fills never sold an unheld lot and never spent past leftover cash. Close cash $9,408.58.

Per-name 09:30 / close marks **PASS** — overnight $ sums to 09:30 equity vs prior close, and on no-fill days intraday $ sums to close equity vs 09:30. No session is skipped.

## Every lot, every session (09:30 mark and same-day change)

Cash does not change overnight and no fees print until a fill. While a lot stays on the book, the 09:30 open vs the prior close is an unrealized overnight move; the close vs that 09:30 open is the same-day unrealized move. Sum of overnight $ = 09:30 equity − prior close equity. On a no-fill day, sum of intraday $ = close equity − 09:30 equity. Bought-today names have overnight $ = 0 (they were not held at the prior close). Sold-at-open names have intraday $ = 0.
