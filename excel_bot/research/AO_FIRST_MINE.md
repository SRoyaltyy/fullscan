# Excel A–O first mine (inventory plan)

_Generated 2026-09-07 · live `flatten_robust` is not changed. No merge without Cyrus._

## Inventory (folded)

- **VISIBLE_COLS A..O (15)** = what daily/backtest grids store (~139 days × OHLCV + 15 fills). Rebuilt this cycle: **3603** from excel-state `state/rows.tar.gz`. Daily `done_grids` is ~3445; excel-state itself has **no** grid JSON.
- **ALL_COLS A..JL (275)** via `run.py --all-cols` exists (#139) but is **not** used by the daily bot. `signal_colors` in suggestions = A→O strip only.
- PIT: SOD/open A,B,C,G,J,K,L,M,O · close D,E,F,H,I,N. `core_score` needs **CLOSE** entry. G/K/M *values* are close-knowable even when the fill clock is open.
- Cards L1–L5 / S1–S2 holdout PASS historically. Live 2026-09-05: L1/L2 −0.55%, L3 +0.35%, L5 −4%. **L4/L5 deferred.**
- Phase-2 A–JL: 35-ticker lean pilot **0 PASS / 0 FAIL / 90 THIN** (`research/ALL_COLS_MINE.md`). Full 3603 rebuild stays scheduled after this A–O surface is exhausted.

## This cycle (recommended order)

1. Open-knowable **a_score / open_score / open_core / combos / lags / gap-J** (never `core_score` at open).
2. Close-entry **L3-like** + non-TP low-vol holds; then **S1/S2**.
3. Beat unconditional same-clock/hold baseline by **≥20 bps** or FAIL `no_edge_vs_uncond`.
4. hold3/5/8 also need hold2 short-horizon edge or FAIL `long_hold_without_hold2`.

Grids **3603**. Patterns **67**. Cells **2283**. **PASS 240** · **FAIL 2043** · **THIN 0**. Cost = futubull 0.15%/0.20%.

### Primary (ALL × hold1/2 only — not cohort/hold8 slices)

**240** PASS cells include overlapping cohort × hold slices of the same defs. The honest sleeve-shaped set is **6** ALL-cohort hold1/2 rows. hold8 / opt / hi-vol slices are not independent edges. Research candidates only — one Jan–Sep 2026 regime, overlapping cluster days, no cards.

## Harden: morning hysteresis light (prove or kill)

_Generated 2026-09-07. Futubull fees kept (0.15% long round-trip). Live `flatten_robust` is not changed. No cards. No merge._

**Proved on this window.** When the morning green light first turns on, buying that name at the open and selling the same close made about **+1.3% to +1.7%** after fees, versus **−0.07%** if you bought everyone. The next-day close is still ahead of the +0.41% everyone-else baseline. Both halves of 2026 and both SPY tapes stay green. The fattest single day is 2–8% of winning-day P&L, not a lottery. Research only — one 2026 regime, no card.

### What the cell means (English first)

Every morning the sheet paints a few cells that are already known at the 9:30 open. Green is plus, red is minus (deep green = +2, light green = +1). When that sum **first** hits +5, the light turns on. We buy that name at **that open** and sell after N sessions. We do **not** ride the whole stretch — one trade at the first morning the light turns on.

- **next 1 session (hold1)** = sell the same day's close.
- **next 2 sessions (hold2)** = sell the next day's close.
- **five-cell light** = A, B, C, G, J (known at the open).
- **nine-cell light** = A, B, C, G, J, K, L, M, O (known at the open).
- Fees are taken off every trade before we judge it.

Everyone-else baseline, same clock and fees, no light required: next-1-session **−0.07%**, next-2-sessions **+0.41%**.

Prove needs **all** of: discovery and holdout both make money; first half and second half of 2026 both make money; SPY-up days **and** SPY-down days both make money; the fattest single **day** is under 25% of winning-day P&L; beat the everyone-else baseline by at least 20 bps. First-half / second-half cut is 2026-05-01.

A–O grids rebuilt: **3603**. Names that lit at least once: **3603**. Candidates: **6**. **KEEP 6** · **KILL 0**.

KEEP is still research-only: one 2026 window, overlapping cluster days, Futubull model, no card, no live wire.

## Color + join mine (open-knowable fills, PIT joins)

_Generated 2026-09-07. Colors are signals, not decoration. Futubull fees kept. Live `flatten_robust` frozen. No cards._

### What a color means

The sheet paints a cell green or red. That paint is the signal. At 9:30 we can already see columns **A, B, C, G, J, K, L, M, O**. Columns D, E, F, H, I, N wait until the close — they never start an open trade. Green = buy at the open. Red = short at the open. Sell after 1 session (same-day close) or 2 sessions (next close).

Everyone-else baseline, same clock and fees: next-1 **−0.07%**, next-2 **+0.41%**.

### Joins (yesterday's tape only)

AB / weather / overnight book use the last file **dated before** the entry date. Same-day files are not knowable at 9:30. AB coverage 14 days (2026-08-19–2026-09-06); book 15 days; weather 20 days. Finviz cohorts are the **current snapshot**, not 2026 history.

Grids **3598**. Cells scored **122**. **KEEP 9** · **THIN 0** · **KILL 113**.

**Color alone does not clear the bar.** One morning cell being green is not enough — the late half of 2026 goes red on same-day holds. The already-proved light **plus a green O** adds about +20–45 bp over the light itself. High-vol Finviz names add +24–64 bp, but that tag is today's snapshot, not 2026 history. AB / weather / overnight book only exist for late Aug–Sep, so they fail walk-forward (no first half).

_Generated 2026-09-07. Live `flatten_robust` frozen. No cards._

### What A–F are

In the real sheet, columns **A–F are STOCKHISTORY**. They alias the daily spill IR:IW (date, close, open, high, low, volume). The emulator must fill that spill from **our** price history — the Yahoo / excel-state rows cache — for the day under test. It must not paste Excel's last-calc cache, and it must not put later bars into that day's A–F.

### Path harden actually used

`rebuild_grids.py` reads `data/rows/<T>.json`, calls `backtest.seed_anchor` / `build_ticker`, and writes `source: rows_cache`. Harden, color-join, and the A–O mines load those grids. They do **not** call `run.py --from-cache` or `validate.build_seeds`.

Grids on disk this run: **3603**. Yahoo/rows rebuilds: **3603**. Excel-cache or untagged: **0**.

**No Excel-cache grids on this disk.** Every mined file is a Yahoo/rows rebuild. The Excel-cache replay path still exists (`run.py --from-cache`) — it is for matching the xlsx, not for harden or walk-forward.

### Day under test vs the tile shortcut

`seed_anchor` only keeps rows with **date ≤ the engine's TODAY**. That TODAY is the **tile anchor** (about every 120 trading days), not each calendar day. So a day in the middle of a tile is painted by an engine that can already see later prices in later rows of IR:IW.

We checked that leak two ways on AAPL (Yahoo rows, not Excel cache):

- **Strip later prices, keep the later TODAY.** 2026-06-26 A–O fills were **identical** to the full later tile. Future daily bars did not change that day's paint.
- **Strict as-of (TODAY = that day) vs the later tile.** Most mid-window days matched. Two open-letter misses: **M** on 2026-07-27 (green vs blank) and **J** on 2026-03-31 (red vs light green). Those are TODAY / window-alignment, not Excel cache, and not “a later close leaked into A–F.”

Days that land on **rows 2–9** of a tile often have no A/B/J/L/M/O highlight — those paint rules start around row 10. That is a **missing color** (we under-count lights), not a peek at the future.

### Other flags (not open-entry)

- **D / E look-ahead:** helper columns CD / CE sum the next five rows. That only paints D and E, which are close-knowable and never start an open trade.
- **Weekly AP:AU** is seeded through the same TODAY. Weekly high/low/vol are treated close.

### Verdict for #144

Harden and walk-forward used the Yahoo/rows rebuild for every ticker on disk. They did **not** reuse Excel's cached A–F. The remaining gap is the **tile TODAY**, not a hidden xlsx dump. KEEP-6 / color-join stay research-only. No live wire.

## Color harden (light + open fill vs light alone)

_Generated 2026-09-07. Color-only beat — no Finviz / AB / weather / book. Futubull fees kept. Live `flatten_robust` frozen. No cards._

### Question

When the morning green light first turns on, does **also** requiring an open-knowable cell to be green (or red) add money after fees, versus the light alone?

Open-knowable paints: **A, B, C, G, J, K, L, M, O**. Close paints D, E, F, H, I, N never start this trade. Same ship bar as the KEEP-6 harden: discovery/holdout, both 2026 halves (cut 2026-05-01), SPY up and down, top-day lottery under 25%, beat the parent light by at least 20 bps. Grids are the Yahoo/rows rebuild (`source: rows_cache`), **3598** files. No Excel cached A–F.

**KEEP 3** recipes · **KILL 3** · **THIN 0**. Color folds that themselves KEEP: **3** (all of them are a green **O**).

**A green O on top of the light can add about +24–45 bp.** Other morning greens (A, B, G, J, K, L, M) do not clear +20 bp versus the light itself. A color by itself, without the light, already failed this bar (late 2026 goes red on same-day holds).
