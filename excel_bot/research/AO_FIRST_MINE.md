# Excel A–O first mine (inventory plan)

_Generated 2026-09-07 · live `flatten_robust` is not changed. No merge without Cyrus._

## Inventory (folded)

- **VISIBLE_COLS A..O (15)** = what daily/backtest grids store (~139 days × OHLCV + 15 fills). Rebuilt this cycle: **3603** from excel-state `state/rows.tar.gz`. Daily `done_grids` is ~3445; excel-state itself has **no** grid JSON.
- **ALL_COLS A..JL (275)** via `run.py --all-cols` exists (#139) but is **not** used by the daily bot. `signal_colors` in suggestions = A→O strip only.
- PIT: SOD/open A,B,C,G,J,K,L,M,O · close D,E,F,H,I,N. `core_score` needs **CLOSE** entry. G/K/M *values* are close-knowable even when the fill clock is open.
- Cards L1–L5 / S1–S2 holdout PASS historically. Live 2026-09-05: L1/L2 −0.55%, L3 +0.35%, L5 −4%. **L4/L5 deferred.**
- Phase-2 A–JL: 35-ticker lean pilot **0 PASS / 0 FAIL / 90 THIN** (`research/ALL_COLS_MINE.md`). Full 3603 rebuild stays scheduled after this A–O surface is exhausted.

## This cycle (recommended order)

1. Open-knowable **a_score / open_score / open_core / combos / lags / gap-J** (never `core_score` at open).
2. Close-entry **L3-like** + non-TP low-vol holds; then **S1/S2**.
3. Beat unconditional same-clock/hold baseline by **≥20 bps** or FAIL `no_edge_vs_uncond`.
4. hold3/5/8 also need hold2 short-horizon edge or FAIL `long_hold_without_hold2`.

Grids **3603**. Patterns **67**. Cells **2283**. **PASS 240** · **FAIL 2043** · **THIN 0**. Cost = futubull 0.15%/0.20%.

### Primary (ALL × hold1/2 only — not cohort/hold8 slices)

**240** PASS cells include overlapping cohort × hold slices of the same defs. The honest sleeve-shaped set is **6** ALL-cohort hold1/2 rows. hold8 / opt / hi-vol slices are not independent edges. Research candidates only — one Jan–Sep 2026 regime, overlapping cluster days, no cards.

## Harden: morning hysteresis light (prove or kill)

_Generated 2026-09-07. Futubull fees kept (0.15% long round-trip). Live `flatten_robust` is not changed. No cards. No merge._

**Proved on this window.** When the morning green light first turns on, buying that name at the open and selling the same close made about **+1.3% to +1.7%** after fees, versus **−0.07%** if you bought everyone. The next-day close is still ahead of the +0.41% everyone-else baseline. Both halves of 2026 and both SPY tapes stay green. The fattest single day is 2–8% of winning-day P&L, not a lottery. Research only — one 2026 regime, no card.

### What the cell means (English first)

Every morning the sheet paints a few cells that are already known at the 9:30 open. Green is plus, red is minus (deep green = +2, light green = +1). When that sum **first** hits +5, the light turns on. We buy that name at **that open** and sell after N sessions. We do **not** ride the whole stretch — one trade at the first morning the light turns on.

- **next 1 session (hold1)** = sell the same day's close.
- **next 2 sessions (hold2)** = sell the next day's close.
- **five-cell light** = A, B, C, G, J (known at the open).
- **nine-cell light** = A, B, C, G, J, K, L, M, O (known at the open).
- Fees are taken off every trade before we judge it.

Everyone-else baseline, same clock and fees, no light required: next-1-session **−0.07%**, next-2-sessions **+0.41%**.

Prove needs **all** of: discovery and holdout both make money; first half and second half of 2026 both make money; SPY-up days **and** SPY-down days both make money; the fattest single **day** is under 25% of winning-day P&L; beat the everyone-else baseline by at least 20 bps. First-half / second-half cut is 2026-05-01.

A–O grids rebuilt: **3603**. Names that lit at least once: **3603**. Candidates: **6**. **KEEP 6** · **KILL 0**.
