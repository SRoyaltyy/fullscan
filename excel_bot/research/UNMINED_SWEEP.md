# Remaining A–JL families — unmined sweep

_Generated 2026-09-07 · live `flatten_robust` frozen. Yahoo/rows A–F seed only. No merge._

## Plain English

Same four leftover families as the 400-name cut (open leftover numbers, close leftover numbers, leftover green/red highlights, 0/1 formula flags). This beat rebuilds A–JL from **every Yahoo/rows cache** (~3,603 names), not a new tiny hand list. Never Excel's STOCKHISTORY cache. Fees are Futubull. We only buy at the open when the sheet already knows the number or the color at 9:30; everything else waits for the close.

A keeper has to work on both ticker halves, both calendar halves (cut 2026-05-01), **Q3** (cut 2026-07-01), both SPY tapes, and must beat 'just buy everyone' by 20 bps. The fattest single day cannot be more than 25% of winning-day P&L. hold1 needs a hold2 sibling; hold5 needs hold2 edge.

Full rows-cache rebuild **3603** tickers (2137 discovery / 1461 holdout) · lean capture **1.2 s/ticker** · specs **2207** · scored cells **3031**.

**KEEP 126 · KILL 2890 · THIN 15** (raw PASS 126 / FAIL 2890 / THIN 15).

Live cards stay frozen. Light+green O remain the only standing A–O color keeps. Finviz volume stays BLOCKED. AB / weather / book stay dead. Leftover-family KEEPs below are research-only on this 2026 tape.

### Family scoreboard

| family | what it is | KEEP | KILL | THIN |

| `fill_new` | leftover green/red highlights | 14 | 286 | 0 |
| `flag` | 0/1 formula flags | 3 | 144 | 0 |

### KEEP (hardened, unique letters)

Raw KEEP **126** collapses to **66** letter×hold cells (**40** hold1/2) on letters `AH/AM/BA/BN/CJ/CZ/EH/EJ/EY/FC/FK/FL/FR/GV/HO/HZ/IB/IK/IL/N/R/T/U`. eq1/ge1/gt0 twins that fire the same days are counted once. These cleared the same bar as light+O (both halves, Q3, both tapes, top-day lottery, beat baseline, horizon sibling). Research only — one 2026 regime. No card.

### Ghost that looked like a KEEP (then died)

Column **DE** paints red when the cell equals 0 (green when it equals 1). The formula that writes DE also reads same-day volume and same-day return H, so we only enter at the **close**.
 `fill_DE_red` short hold5: disc 40603/+0.59%/t=4.1, hold 27759/+0.91%/t=14.0, Q3 —, late 327/+2.23%/t=3.0. hold2: 27759/+0.11%/t=2.5. **KILL** (q3_missing).

### Exhaustion

126 leftover cells KEEP on the full Yahoo/rows set. The regions with KEEP 0 are null here; KEEP rows still need another regime before anyone would wire a card.

A–F seed: Yahoo/rows cache via `seed_anchor`. Capture path `lean_rows_cache` · excel STOCKHISTORY cache used: False.

Research only. No cards. Live `flatten_robust` untouched.
