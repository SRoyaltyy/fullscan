This file is the **human read** of one run. CSV/JSON next to it are the machine files.

## How today's action is built

**BUY is the green pile when it is thick enough** (every horizon, including 1d). A name is all-green when join / general / AB / peer are each ≥ +0.05, sector and news are yellow or missing (not red), and Finviz relvol is not in (0, 0.7) when printed. 1d still requires lattice `bull_eligible` so a hard-red market can empty the sleeve. SELL is core weights on the non-green remainder. The lattice is the thin-pile fallback and still writes the watch list:

1. **Market gate** — raw general factor scoreboard + risk state sets exposure. An extreme confirmed red day closes ordinary longs.
2. **Parent / child route** — sector tape/essay and independent industry/theme absolute + relative strength decide where.
3. **Company route** — News Judge adjudicates; actions, Finviz digest and dossiers form one deduplicated direct-event decision.
4. **Setup / flow gate** — intrinsic AB + join structure, peer RS, price/gap and time-aware relative volume decide whether now.
5. **Rank inside the lane** — standard, group-leader or catalyst. mid_opp cannot grant permission.

The existing red/yellow/green source graph remains visible. Its digest, judge and catalyst cells are now populated before selection. 🔵 / 🚨 / ⚪, Cond, region and featured fades remain gates. A second six-domain row prevents duplicate headlines from voting three times. Longer horizons use the same pile; they do not wait on a separate 1d lattice experiment.

## Today's regime

- Weather risk: **off**
- General predict (same-day): +0.50 up (present)
- Stand-down: **no** — 319 names qualified through standard,group_leader,catalyst (13 probable)
- Sector predicts this date: 0/11 (missing → sector layer is 0; Finviz week tape still sits in join)
- News tickers in play: 149
- AB coverage: 1907 names · peer RS: 1804
- Universe after liquidity: 2035
- BUY window: $80M ADV, opportunity $400M–$20B, max 4/sector, 3/industry, 4 large/mega
- News names after digest+judge: 65

## All-green BUY / SELL

- Mode: **green_pile** · SELL **core_weights_ex_green**
- Pile: **148** liquid all-green names (need ≥ 8) of 2035
- Core fired: join=yes, AB=yes, peer=yes
- pile 148 ≥ 8 liquid all-green names — BUY 15 from the pile by green_rank (no opp); SELL is core weights on the non-green remainder

## Decision lattice — gate → route → rank

The weighted score is now a tie-breaker inside an eligible lane. It cannot average away a market, group, company, or setup veto.

### MARKET: 🟡 YELLOW

- YELLOW: general up score=+2.12; good=+1.8 vs bad=-1.0; risk=off; red pillars=1
- Allowed long lanes: **standard, group_leader, catalyst** · max slots 8 · size ×0.60
- Bull evidence: rates / Fed +1.00 points; oil / dollar +0.50 points; futures +0.25 points
- Bear evidence: global sessions -1.00 points

Decision domains: **MKT · parent · child · company · setup · flow**. Measured parent/child tape is kept separate from the LLM essay; direct company events must be price-confirmed on a hard-red day.
